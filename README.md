I love tennis, so I wanted to demonstrate that it's possible to understand a match just from the data, even if we haven’t watched it or don’t remember the result. I obtained data from a match between two tennis legends, Nadal and Djokovic, and carried out an analysis in Python to uncover what happened on the court several years ago.
